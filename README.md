# TheSquid15 aka Keystroker Deluxe 🤖

Hey! I'm a Web Developer and a design wizard 🧙
I love coding but I'm too scared to contribute to public repos, so most of the stuff I work on are my own projects. 

## Here are some things about me:
- 🐘 I like to use PHP
- ✨ I love using Javascript
- 🐍 I think Python is pretty cool
- 🔰 Lua is great, so far...
- 🦑 I don't know why I chose the handle TheSquid15
- 🕸️ Web technologies make my knees weak
- 📚 I'm interested in books, movies and video games
- ⚛️ Just started learning React
